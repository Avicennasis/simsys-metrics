## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-25

First public release of the Node sibling package. See the
[root CHANGELOG](../CHANGELOG.md) for the full feature set; Node-specific
notes:

- Express 5 + Hono 4 adapters share a single metric catalogue.
- `process.cpuUsage()` is exposed as a monotonic counter using delta-based
  increments — preserves prom-client's reset-detection (no reset()+inc()
  pattern that would break `rate()` over scrape boundaries).
- Hono adapter detects the wildcard middleware path (`/*`) as unmatched so
  unrouted requests collapse to `route="__unmatched__"` rather than leaking
  the wildcard pattern.
- ESM-only, requires Node ≥ 18 (declared via `engines`).
- Tarball distribution via GitHub Releases; install URL is the
  `simsys-metrics-0.3.0.tgz` asset attached to the `node-v0.3.0` release.

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/Avicennasis/simsys-metrics/releases/tag/node-v0.3.0
